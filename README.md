### üìà  Visualization components

- Map

On the home page, we have a map which represents all the stations with a popup describing the name and address of it.

- Bar Chart

Still on the home page, the popup allows us to display the details of a station. These details are in the form of two bar charts: one for statistics on the number of passengers and another for canceled or late trains. Regarding the second diagram, it has been implemented but some errors remain with the uic-code.

- Line Chart

The online diagram allows you to visualize the statistics on the objects found, classified by station and by date. The user has the right to a parameter selector to refine his search.

- Table 

With menu, we have the option to search by station, but for this some other information that could help users. We enter the name of a station and we have the result in tabular form.
